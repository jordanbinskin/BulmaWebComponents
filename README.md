## Creating a new component


## Everything in public folder is temporary!

**Important note:** Any file in public folder is copied there as part of the gulp build process.

See `src` folder for original files to edit.

## Static and Dynamic components

Dynamic components are a feature for integrating with your backend systems on page load, feeding dynamic data to a
